# Book platform

This is a project developed with [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
to query and list books from the Google [Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).
The project was structured to use [Atomic Design](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-atomic-design) as the base for folder structuring.

The deployed project can be found [here](https://book-platform.vercel.app/)
